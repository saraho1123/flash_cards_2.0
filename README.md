###Project Summary

This was me second attempt at first sole project for Module 2 at Turing School of Software and Design. I decide to repeat the Module to gain deeper understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts.

The goal of FlashCards project was to get better understanding OOP focusing on SRP and using TDD to build out a game that would run purely in the Terminal.

Doing this project for the second time was easier but I wanted to push myself and add extensions and focus on my Github workflow committing often and using PR requests at appropriate time in the code.



###Playing The Game

To play the game you need to first follow the installation instructions at the bottom of the ReadMe. When you start the game by running ‘node index.js’ you will see a multiple choice question that you can answer by using up/down arrows and enter key to record your answer.
At the end of the game you will be given percentage of correct answers and how long it took you to to the round.



###Setup Instructions

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub).

      git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

     npm install


Running node index.js from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal:

    At this point the game should run
